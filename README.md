# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description
The AirBnB Clone is a command-line interpreter that mimics some functionality of the AirBnB website. It is the starting point of a larger project to build a clone of the AirBnB platform. This project focuses on developing the backend of the application using Python and OOP concepts.

The command interpreter allows users to:
- Create, retrieve, update, and delete objects.
- Serialize and deserialize objects to/from JSON.
- Manage objects in storage.

## Command Interpreter

### How to Start It
